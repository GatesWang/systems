Workload plan

When choosing to free or allocate we specify three parameters.
1)free
2)create
3)size

The probability that we free a pointer is free / (free + create).
The probability that we create a pointer is create / (free + create).
If we create we allocate size memory.


D
For this workload we choose free=7, create=12, and size=1.
We are much more likely to allocate than free, so we should have many pointers.
We should not run out of memory since our size is 1.


E
For this workload we choose free=12, create=7, and size=300.
We are much more likely to free than allocate, so we should have few pointers.
However, we are allocating large sizes so we will easily run out of memory.
